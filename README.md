# scores
This repository contains the source code of the scores which I have engraved using GNU LilyPond. Some of the scores which are public domain will be uploaded on IMSLP and the PDFS are licensed as CC-BY-SA, while the source code is licensed as GPL. The other scores I have engraved for personal use or for other platforms.
