# scores
This repository contains the source code of the scores which I have engraved using GNU LilyPond. Some of the scores which are public domain will be uploaded on IMSLP and the PDFs are licensed as CC-BY-SA, while the source code is licensed as GPL. The other scores I have engraved for personal use or for other platforms.  
You're free to use the source code and PDFs of the files for whatever purpose you wish as long as you respect the licenses.
